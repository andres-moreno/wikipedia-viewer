Build a Wikipedia Viewer
========================

This project fullfills the requirement for a
freecodecamp [challenge][fccChallenge].

Build a web page that allows users to search Wikipedia entries. The
user is presented with the top 10 entries matching the query. If there
is no match, no entries are chosen. Addtionally, the user can click a
button to get a random Wikipedia entry.

User Stories
------------

* User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see
  the resulting Wikipedia entries.

* User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

Technical Point of the Challenge
--------------------------------

The main new idea in this challenge is the direct manipulation of the
DOM. I chose to use plain Javascript to insert/delete nodes into the
DOM corresponding to the entries returned from the search.

Another benefit from this challenge is exposure to the Wikipedia API
as a model and its documentation and tooling (e.g. sandbox).
